# MischievousMailMan

A Vanilla WoW Addon to spam your friends and foes with hundreds upon hundreds of items via the ingame mailing system.

1. Open your mailbox (addons can't interact with ingame objects).
2. Type /mmm RecipientName ItemLink in the chatbox. Create an ItemLink by shift-clicking any item in your inventory.
3. The item you linked will be sent to the recipient one at a time.
3. Watch and laugh deviously.

Known limitations:
- You need at least one free spot in your bags.
- May not be compatible with some mail addons (but is confirmed to be compatible with CT_MailMod)
- Does not check for sufficient copper for the mail postage.
- Does not check for correct spelling of recipient.
- Your cursor should not hold an item when you run the command.
- Don't try moving items when the /mmm command is running. This may send your items away.
- The addon does not understand different bag types. It should not be a problem if your last bag is - for example - a herb bag. There may however be problems if your only free slot is in one of those or if your specialty bag is not your last bag etc.
- Usage of this addon may result in angering the recipient. With great power comes great responsibility.
